Android Notification Action View
================================

The project requires the support library and if imported into Eclipse it will try and reference ANDROID_HOME to find it. You can add this to your workspace by going to Preferences > General > Workspace > Linked Resources and add ANDROID_HOME pointing to your SDK directory.
